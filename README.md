# Solar Tracker
Jupyter notebook for calculating the location of the sun for any date and time, 
given the observers location on the earths surface.

Before I became a software developer, I was a sculptor. I specialised in high-precision sundials, and traded under the name 'Precision Sundials'.

This was in the age before smartphones, and when measuring up for large public pieces, I often spent a long time with calculator, maps and a theodolite that I had purchased in an army surplus store. This meant that if I arrived on site on a sunny day with this kit, I could calculate True north to a fraction of a degree, something that cannot be done with a magnetic compass.

This notebook is a workbook I will use to refer to in creating the Android app that follows.
If smartphones had been available then, and if I had the programming skills that I have now, my life would have been so much easier...
